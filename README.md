There are two pages: the home page and the details page. A menu button is located in the top right corner of the home page, and then a large good morning to you.
 A search bar with a rounded corner follows, followed by a selection of workouts for you. Finally, there is a Bottom navigation bar at the bottom.


 On the right side of the page is a yoga lady vector with a small search bar,
 and on the top of the page is a title with a short description of the course. Then there's the schedule of sessions. The second portion of the course is at the bottom.
